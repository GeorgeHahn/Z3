2785 (61%)  - Procedual
2146 (47%)	- DoOp moved to state
2082 (45%)	- + Delayed assignment
1508 (33%)  - + Oper read assignment
1531 (33%)	- + Fix memStack stuff (ish)

2145 (47%)		- Delayed assignment fixes + added print + better testbed + data change oper
24882 (540%) 	- Routines (32 deep) and more ops
11460 (222%)	- Routines (4 deep) => Stack needs moving into memory. On chip?
4257 (92%)		- Removed Routines
2451 (53%)		- Removed Routines + new ops
2451 (53%)		- Removed Routines + new ops
2529 (45%)		- + 0Ops
4266 (93%)		- + 2Ops
3653 (79%)		- + 2Ops (-LoadB/LoadW)
2785 (60%)		- + 2Ops (-IncChk)

6476 (141%)		- Enough ops to get to first input read
266				- No DoOp logic (probably everything compiled out)
1644 (36%)		- + 0Ops
3023 (66%)		- + 1Ops
4183 (91%)		- + VarOps
6669 (145%)		- Back to full with fixed MOD instruction
6597 (143%)		- + Simple DoBranch instructions moved to state
5460 (118%)		- + Reduce number stack from 32->4 (FIXME!)
4991 (108%)		- + Remove MOD (not used)
4626 (100%)		- + Remove DIV (could do less efficiently?)

3271 (71%)		- Removed localRegs + stack from internal state (and -MOD) + StoreRegister now a state
3657			- Removed memStack (+MOD)
3332 (72%)		- Removed memStack (-MOD) : Erm... why bigger?
3222 (70%)		- Reduce phase to 4 bits
3202 (69%)		- Remove temp2

4034 (88%)		- Printing system + All ops but (MOD/remove_obj/insert_obj)
4503 (98%)		- All ops except MOD

5373 (117%)		- Reset + full printing system (except print_num)
5125 (111%)		- Print state collapse
5053 (110%)		- Removed some duplicate driving

Todo:
	Reset logic				(Fairly simple)
	Improve print system	(Problem: Abbreviations + print char/num/newline)
	Lexical analysis		(Problem: Dictionary)
